For the first option, you will collect information for a participant.  

[x] They study people who want to know the personâ€™s first name, last name, age, and gender. 

[x] Participants should be assigned an id value (not a random number).  

[x] Then if the id value is even then the participant will receive StudyMor, if the id value is odd they will receive a placebo.  Whether or not they receive StudyMor should be recorded in the data file.


For the second option, 

[x] Display all participants to the user

[x] the user gets to choose a participant from the list of participants and enter survey data for them. 

[_] Each week they will distribute either StudyMor or the placebo to the participant. They will ask the user will then ask the participant the following questions and record the answers.

- Did you have any headaches using StudyMor?
- Did you have any constipation using StudyMor?
- Did you experience any difficulty sleeping while using StudyMor?
- List any other potential side effects, you experienced using StudyMor.
- Did you feel like you could study more using StudyMor?

[] To make things a little easier to manage you should keep the survey data in a separate file from the participant list. ie: "survey.dat". 

[] Each survey data entry should start with the date the survey information was collected and the participant id so we can properly match the survey data to the participant.
